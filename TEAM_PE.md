# Team Policies and Expectations

## Instructor's Expectations and Responsabilities for All Students

### Project Iteration Responsibilities of the Team (as a Team)
* Together, determine the distribution of work and design this distribution so that it is possible for each team member to contribute a roughly equal effort toward the success of the project. Make your best guess about this at the start of the project, and refine the responsibilities if needed as you go. Consult the instructor if any issues arise or you need clarifications.

We plan on discussing the project and distribution of work in more detail Friday (11/27). The group will read over the iteration in the meantime. The remaining tasks of refactoring code, addition of features and testing will be discussed more in depth Friday so we'll be updating this document in more detail then. We'll split that work up evenly as possible and edit this document as we discuss ideas.

#### Distribution of Work
**Step 1: Please, provide here a brief description (one short paragraph) of the distribution of work across your team. You can refine this description as you carry out the project iteration.**

### Project Responsibilities of the Individual
* Individually, contribute to the success of the team according to the policies and schedule agreed upon by all team members. Individually, create the opportunity for everyone in your group to succeed at being a good team member - don't do all the work yourself.
Project responsiobilities will be deterimined in our meeting on Nov 27.
